Create [diceware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware) password/passphrase you can actually remember! This module is based on the principle that truly random selection of words from a wordlist, can result in easily memorable passwords that are also extremely resistant to attack.

## Usage

```js
const passphrase = require('diceware-passphrase')

// generate random diceware passphrase
passphrase()
// => ['zoom', 'clamp', 'dedicate', 'armed', 'sworn', 'unroll', 'dial']
```


## Installation

```shell
npm install diceware-passphrase --save
```
